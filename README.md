# Restaurant Page

## An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/restaurant-page)

*"Let’s use what we’ve learned about ES6 modules and take a chance to continue practicing DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a simple restaurant homepage! By the end, we are going to be using JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website!"*
